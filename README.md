I have implemented an algorithm using python that can be implemented in drones where the user can choose the start location of the drone and the destination it has to reach, there will be employed a grid where there are obstacles planted across the grid that will be moving dynamically while interfering the drone's path so i have implemented an algorithm using A* algorithm to recalculate and choose the next nearest path for the drone to move towards the destination i have used matplotlib for the visualization
